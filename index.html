    <h1>My name is Aalanah</h1>
    <p>I am currently a data science student. I got into the degree path because I enjoy organizing data and coding. On top of learning HTML in this class, I am also working on learning Python. In my free-time, I am a writer, and I am currently working on my first novel.
